## Game Overview

You begin as a civilian within one of three tribes and develop through skill trees, jobs, and choices that influence the tribe's fate.

Each in-game day, you spend stamina on actions — farming, hunting, gathering, trading, exploring, or visiting NPCs — to progress your character and influence your tribe's overall development.
